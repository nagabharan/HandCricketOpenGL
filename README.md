HandCricketOpenGL
=================
This project "Hand-Cricket" demonstrates a simple game developed on the OpenGL platform, which is typically used to interact with a GPU, to 
achieve hardware-accelerated rendering. As the name suggests "Hand-Cricket" is a game in which the user needs to use hands to play and score as many run as possible. We have 
imposed a maximum of 30 balls per innings to keep it interesting. User can win if he able to make the computer out before reaching the target. The gameplay is represented via human 
hands, which change according to user and computer inputs. We have used SOIL (Simple OpenGL Image Library) which allows users to load images directly to OpenGL textures. We 
have made use of different API's to provide a nice interface for playing. Once the match is completed, statistics of the runs scored by the user will be displayed and the game concludes.
